# Project Overview

## Vision Statement
The Weather Analytics Dashboard aims to transform complex meteorological information into intuitive, actionable insights. The vision is to build a comprehensive and user-friendly weather analytics platform that empowers users with data-driven decision-making.

## Problem Statement
Traditional weather apps present data in simplistic formats with limited analytics. Users seeking deeper insights navigate multiple sources, resulting in a fragmented experience. This project addresses that by providing:
- Unified Platform: All weather data and analytics in one place
- Advanced Visualization: Interactive charts and maps
- Actionable Insights: Analysis and recommendations
- Professional Tools: Export and integration options

## Target Audience
Primary Users
1. Data Analysts
2. Business Decision Makers
3. Weather Enthusiasts
4. Academic Researchers

Secondary Users
1. Event Planners
2. Travelers
3. Agricultural Professionals
4. Energy Sector Workers

## Core Features
- Real-Time Weather Data: current conditions, location-based, multi-source, live updates
- Advanced Forecasting: 7-day forecast, hourly trends, probabilities, accuracy metrics
- Interactive Visualization: dynamic charts, weather maps, comparison tools, customizable views
- Analytics & Insights: trends, anomalies, risk assessment, predictive insights
- User Experience: responsive, theme options, intuitive interface, accessibility

## Technical Approach
Frontend: React, TypeScript (optional), Tailwind CSS, Recharts, Leaflet
Backend: FastAPI, Python, MongoDB, Pydantic

## Data Flow
1. User Input → 2. API Request → 3. Data Processing → 4. State Update → 5. UI Refresh

## Security Considerations
- API key protection
- Input validation
- Rate limiting
- HTTPS

## Success Metrics
User Engagement: DAU, session duration, feature adoption
Technical Performance: page load, API response time, uptime
Business Impact: satisfaction, export usage, mobile traffic

## Roadmap Summary
